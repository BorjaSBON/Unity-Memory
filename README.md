The more games a player finishes, the more points it will earns, depending on the number of pairs per board. There are different difficulties where the number of pairs and the number of points earned per pair solved vary. The default modes that serve as a tutorial are:
- <b>Easy</b>: There are 5 pairs and 10 points are earned per pair.
- <b>Normal</b>: There are 7 pairs and 15 points are earned per pair.
- <b>Hard</b>: There are 12 pairs and 20 points are earned per pair.

There is a custom mode where the player can select the number of elements it wants to play. Depending on this number, 5, 10, 15 or 20 points can be won per pair solved.
For this custom mode, the items that appear and the position in which they are located is completely random, so each game is unique.

For each game, data is collected on the number of points scored and the time taken to solve the board. In addition, in the main menu you can see the total number of points obtained throughout all the games.
